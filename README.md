# openDavisISS
Receives radio packets from Davis wireless ISS (EU version) with an Adafruit Feather M0 RFM69HCW and makes both console and data logger obsolete.

# Introduction
This is the corresponding github repository for my [DIY project](http://cleveres-heim.de/howto/diy-projekt-davis-vantage-pro-2-wetterstation-ohne-konsole-und-ohne-datenlogger-betreiben/) building up a open source Davis radio receiver. Since the development is limited to the EU version of Davis Vantage Pro 2, the whole description and story in my blog is also in German. Sorry for that!
